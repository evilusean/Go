sudo docker pull nginx #run an nginx docker image

sudo docker run -d nginx #run nginx docker image
sudo docker ps #To confirm current running containers
sudo docker ps -a #view all containers, both running and those that have previously been stopped
sudo docker stop 968ff5caba7f #To stop a container, use the docker stop command followed by the container ID. For instance, to stop the Nginx container
sudo docker pull ubuntu:20.04 #To better illustrate this, we are going to download the Ubuntu 20.04 docker image.
sudo docker run -it ubuntu:20.04 #Some containers spawned from OS images may require some user interaction. interact with a Ubuntu container image and access the shell to run commands, use the -it flag.
sudo docker run -p 8080:80 nginx #Sometimes, you may want to run a web server container and map its port to the host system to achieve this, use the -p option
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER #
newgrp docker #If you want to user docker commands with sudo command then add your local user to docker group
